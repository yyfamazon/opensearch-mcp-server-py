## OpenSearch MCP Server

**opensearch-mcp-server-py** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for OpenSearch that enables AI assistants to interact with OpenSearch clusters. It provides a standardized interface for AI models to perform operations like searching indices, retrieving mappings, and managing shards through both stdio and streaming (SSE/Streamable HTTP) protocols.

**Key features:**

- Seamless integration with AI assistants and LLMs through the MCP protocol
- Support for both stdio and streaming server transports (SSE and Streamable HTTP)
- Built-in tools for common OpenSearch operations
- Easy integration with Claude Desktop and LangChain
- Secure authentication using basic auth or IAM roles

## Installing opensearch-mcp-server-py

Opensearch-mcp-server-py can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opensearch-mcp-server-py/) via pip:

```
pip install opensearch-mcp-server-py
```

## Available Tools

By default, only **core tools** are enabled to provide essential OpenSearch functionality:

### Core Tools (Enabled by Default)

Core tools are grouped under the `core_tools` category and can be disabled at once using `OPENSEARCH_DISABLED_CATEGORIES=core_tools`. Avoid creating custom categories with this name as they will override the built-in category.

- [ListIndexTool](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/cat/cat-indices/): Lists all indices in OpenSearch with full information including docs.count, docs.deleted, store.size, etc. If an index parameter is provided, returns detailed information about that specific index.
- [IndexMappingTool](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/tools/index-mapping-tool/): Retrieves index mapping and setting information for an index in OpenSearch.
- [SearchIndexTool](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/tools/search-index-tool/): Searches an index using a query written in query domain-specific language (DSL) in OpenSearch.
- [GetShardsTool](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/cat/cat-shards/): Gets information about shards in OpenSearch.
- [ClusterHealthTool](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/cluster-api/cluster-health/): Returns basic information about the health of the cluster.
- [CountTool](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/search-apis/count/): Returns number of documents matching a query.
- [ExplainTool](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/search-apis/explain/): Returns information about why a specific document matches (or doesn't match) a query.
- [MsearchTool](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/search-apis/multi-search/): Allows to execute several search operations in one request.
- [GenericOpenSearchApiTool]: A flexible tool that can call any OpenSearch API endpoint with custom paths, methods, query parameters, and request bodies. Reduces tool explosion by providing a single interface for all OpenSearch APIs.
